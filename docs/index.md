## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Mrymvaa/CSS-Flexbox-and-Grid-Layout/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.



Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mrymvaa/CSS-Flexbox-and-Grid-Layout/settings/pages).
